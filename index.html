        <h2>LOTR</h2>
        <p>
          In a sleepy village in the Shire, a young hobbit is entrusted with an
          immense task. He must make a perilous journey across Middle-earth to
          the Cracks of Doom, there to destroy the Ruling Ring of Power – the
          only thing that prevents the Dark Lord Sauron’s evil dominion.

          Mr and Mrs Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say
          that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the
          last people you’d expect to be involved in anything strange or
          mysterious, because they just didn’t hold with such nonsense.

        <h2>GOT</h2>
        <p>
          The morning had dawned clear and cold, with a crispness that hinted at
          the end of summer. They set forth at daybreak to see a man beheaded,
          twenty in all, and Bran rode among them, nervous with excitement. This
          was the first time he had been deemed old enough to go with his lord
          father and his brothers to see the king's justice done. It was the
          ninth year of summer, and the seventh of Bran's life.
